## Why?
Imagine you have a music album that is already sorted according to the track numbers in the metadata. However, if you open the album in a file manager that does not support certain metadata, the songs will be sorted alphabetically. Renamby26 can be used to sort your songs correctly by their file names, ensuring they are organized as intended.
## How to Use
- Adding Prefixes Automatically
Select your music files and click the "Add/Update prefix according to its №" button to add a numerical prefix to each file name based on its track number in the metadata.

**Manual Mode**
- If your files do not have track numbers in their metadata, you can select the files one by one in your desired order in manual mode and click "Set №" to assign numbers to them. After that, you can immediately add the numerical prefix to the file names by pressing "Add/Update Prefix".
The "Add/Update Prefix" function can also be used independently if you don't need track numbers.

#### Note on Manual Sorting
If you need to change both the track number (№) and the numeric prefix, start by setting the track number, then update the prefix. This sequence ensures the program can locate the files correctly — changing the name first will cause the program to lose track of the files, as the list will still reference their original names.
